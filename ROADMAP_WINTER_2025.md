## üìù Notes from Development

### Key Insights
1. **Progressive Reveal Pattern**: Show marker ‚Üí toast ‚Üí analysis works better than immediate modal
2. **Educational First**: When no hotspot found, teach users what to look for
3. **Community Data**: Every interaction should contribute to collective intelligence
4. **Visual Feedback**: Users need immediate confirmation their actions worked
5. **Reusability**: Tools should reset cleanly for continuous use

### Technical Decisions
- Turf.js for geodesic calculations prevents projection distortions
- Toast notifications better than modals for non-blocking feedback
- LocalStorage for user preferences, Supabase for shared data
- Mapbox GL for performance, React for interactivity

### User Feedback Themes
- "Make it feel like magic" - Jeff
- "The parallelogram looked broken" - Fixed with turf.bboxPolygon
- "I want to snip multiple times quickly" - Implemented reset flow
- "Show me where everyone's catching fish" - Future heat map feature
