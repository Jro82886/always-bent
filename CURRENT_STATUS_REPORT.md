# üéØ ABFI Current Status Report
*Last Updated: December 21, 2024*

## ‚úÖ What's DONE:
1. **Build & Deployment** - App builds and deploys successfully
2. **Authentication Bypass** - Multiple routes to access app without auth
3. **Welcome Page** - Loads with proper styling
4. **Direct Access Pages** - `/go`, `/direct`, `/view` all work
5. **Environment Variables** - Set in Vercel (need verification)

## ‚ùå What's NOT Working:
1. **Map Not Loading** - Likely Mapbox token issue
2. **Polygons** - Need to verify if backend is generating them
3. **Ocean Data Layers** - SST/CHL may not be displaying
4. **Vessel Tracking** - Status unknown

## üîç What We Need to Check:

### 1. Environment Variables in Vercel
Go to: https://vercel.com/jro82886s-projects/always-bent/settings/environment-variables

Verify these are set:
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] `POLYGONS_BACKEND_URL`
- [ ] `COPERNICUS_USER`
- [ ] `COPERNICUS_PASS`

### 2. Direct Test URLs:
- Landing: https://always-bent.vercel.app/
- Direct Access: https://always-bent.vercel.app/direct
- Analysis Mode: https://always-bent.vercel.app/legendary/analysis
- Check Page: https://always-bent.vercel.app/check

### 3. Backend Status:
- Polygon API: Check if Cloud Run is deployed
- GitHub Action: Check if scheduled polygon generation is running

## üé¨ Next Actions:

1. **Visit `/check` page** - See which env vars are missing
2. **Add missing env vars** in Vercel
3. **Check polygon backend** - Is it deployed? Is it generating data?
4. **Test map loading** - Once env vars are set

## üõë Stop Looping On:
- Authentication fixes (it's bypassed)
- Build errors (it's building)
- Welcome page (it works)

## üéØ Focus Only On:
1. Getting the map to load (Mapbox token)
2. Verifying polygons are being generated
3. Confirming ocean data displays

---

## Quick Test Checklist:
1. Go to: https://always-bent.vercel.app/check
2. Screenshot what you see
3. Tell me which variables are "NOT SET"
4. We'll fix ONLY those issues
