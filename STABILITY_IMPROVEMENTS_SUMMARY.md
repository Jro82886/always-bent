# ABFI Stability Improvements - Phase 1 Complete

## What We've Done

### PR-1: Error Boundaries + Type Safety
✅ Added React Error Boundaries to prevent crashes
✅ Created centralized API client with Zod validation
✅ Fixed TypeScript config (strict mode)
✅ Added proper error handling throughout

### PR-2: Linting Rules + Contracts
✅ Enhanced ESLint config with strict rules
✅ Created schema placeholders for contracts
✅ Added CI check for smooth rendering (not pixelation)
✅ Fixed import issues and type errors

### PR-3: State Management Unification
✅ Created focused UIStore for UI state
✅ Added React Query for server state management
✅ Clear separation between UI and server state
✅ Proper caching and invalidation strategies

### PR-4: Security Hygiene
✅ Enhanced middleware with security headers
✅ Implemented rate limiting (60 req/min for sensitive endpoints)
✅ Added CORS configuration with whitelist
✅ Created /api/version endpoint for monitoring

### PR-5: Testing Infrastructure
✅ Set up Vitest for unit tests
✅ Set up Playwright for E2E tests
✅ Added basic smoke tests for Analysis page
✅ Created test for API client

### PR-6: CI/CD Pipeline
✅ GitHub Actions workflow for all PRs
✅ Automated typecheck, lint, test, build
✅ Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit checks
✅ Prettier for consistent code formatting

## Benefits

1. **Stability**: Error boundaries prevent app crashes
2. **Type Safety**: Zod validation ensures API contracts
3. **Developer Experience**: Auto-formatting, linting on commit
4. **Security**: Rate limiting, security headers, CORS
5. **Quality**: Automated tests catch regressions
6. **Monitoring**: Version endpoint, structured logging ready

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Push these changes to main
2. **Monitor**: Watch error rates and performance
3. **Iterate**: Add more tests as issues arise
4. **Scale**: Upgrade rate limiting to Redis/Upstash

## Commands

```bash
# Run tests locally
npm test           # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e   # E2E tests

# Development
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run lint       # Check linting
npm run typecheck  # Check types
npm run build      # Production build
```

## Architecture Improvements

- **Clear separation**: UI state (Zustand) vs Server state (React Query)
- **Type safety**: End-to-end types from API to UI
- **Error handling**: Consistent Result<T, E> pattern
- **Security**: Defense in depth with multiple layers

This is a solid foundation for a production application. The codebase is now more maintainable, testable, and resilient to errors.
