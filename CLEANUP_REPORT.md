# Cleanup Report - September 26, 2025

## Branch Status

### Safety Tag Created
- `pre-scrub-20250926` - Snapshot before cleanup

### Merged Branches (can be deleted)
The following branches have been merged to main and can be safely removed:
- origin/chore/auth-skeleton-and-live
- origin/feature/analysis-full-breakdown-v1
- origin/surgical/* (multiple feature branches)

### Active Branches to Keep
- `main` - Production branch
- `staging` - Staging environment
- `stability/phase-1` - Current working branch

## Code Analysis Results

### TypeScript Compilation
✅ No TypeScript errors found

### Identified Legacy/Unused Files

#### Already Deleted
- `/src/components/SnipTool.tsx` - Replaced by SimpleSnipTool
- `/src/components/analysis/DynamicAnalysisModal.tsx` - Integrated into main flow
- `/src/styles/analysis-debug.css` - Debug styles no longer needed
- `/src/__tests__/no-static-analysis.test.tsx` - Test completed its purpose

#### Candidates for Archival
- SQL migration scripts in root (FIX_*.sql) - Move to `/legacy/sql/`
- Shell scripts for one-time fixes - Move to `/legacy/scripts/`

### Dependencies Review

All current dependencies appear to be in use:
- Core: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Mapping: Mapbox GL, MapboxDraw, Turf.js
- Data: Supabase, SWR, React Query
- UI: Tailwind, Lucide icons, Framer Motion
- Utils: date-fns, uuid, base64-js

### Environment Configuration

✅ Created `.env.example` with all required variables
✅ Created `CONFIG.md` with detailed flag explanations

## Recommendations

1. **Branch Cleanup**: Delete merged feature branches after confirming with team
2. **SQL Scripts**: Archive one-time migration scripts to keep root clean
3. **Test Coverage**: Add integration tests for critical paths (Analysis, Chat, Trends)
4. **Documentation**: Keep SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md updated with each major change

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve branch deletions
2. Move identified files to legacy/
3. Set up basic CI/CD checks
4. Regular dependency audits (monthly)
