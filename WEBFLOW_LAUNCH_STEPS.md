**SIMPLE & PROFESSIONAL:**
- Dark background (#030712)
- Cyan accents (#22d3ee)
- Clean typography

**Your app is the star** - the website just needs to:

2. Let people sign up
3. Direct them to the app

1. **Background:** Dark (#030712)
2. **Hero text:** Your messaging
3. **Navbar logo:** Your ABFI logo
4. **CTA button:** "Start Free Beta"
5. **Link to app:** Launch button works

That's it! Don't overcomplicate!

## ðŸ’¡ REMEMBER

- **Less is more** - Clean design wins
- **One logo** in navbar is enough
- **Dark + Cyan** = Your brand
- **Working > Perfect** - Launch, then iterate

1. **Test everything** on staging
2. **GoDaddy:** Update DNS (see GODADDY_DOMAIN_SETUP.md)

If Webflow gets complex, remember:

- The website is just the front door

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Get it live! ðŸŽ£
