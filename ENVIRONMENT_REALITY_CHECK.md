# üîç Environment Variables - What's Really Happening

## The Problem:
Environment variables aren't "deleted" - they're just not where they need to be.

## The Reality:

### 1. **Local Development** (your computer)
- Uses `.env.local` file
- This file is gitignored (not uploaded to GitHub)
- Works fine on your machine

### 2. **GitHub Repository**
- NEVER stores environment variables (security)
- Only has documentation files with the values
- This is correct behavior

### 3. **Vercel Deployment** (production)
- Needs env vars set in Vercel Dashboard
- These are separate from your local files
- Must be added manually through Vercel's UI

## Why It Seems Like They're "Deleted":
- You set them locally ‚Üí works on your computer ‚úÖ
- You push to GitHub ‚Üí they're not included (correct) ‚úÖ
- Vercel builds ‚Üí can't find them (because they're not set in Vercel) ‚ùå

## üéØ THE SOLUTION:

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
https://vercel.com/jro82886s-projects/always-bent/settings/environment-variables

### Step 2: Add These Variables
Click "Add New" and paste each one:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoiYWx3YXlzYmVudCIsImEiOiJjbTJqeWJhcGUwZnppMmtzNjJtcDN6bnFnIn0.U7aqDmXmN1gvk-0VcpHnog
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEMBERSTACK_APP_ID=app_cmfpavrtq00zb0wws6asv8xf3
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://hobvjmmambhonsugehge.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[Get from Supabase Dashboard]
COPERNICUS_USER=jrosenkilde

POLYGONS_BACKEND_URL=https://always-bent-python-1039366079125.us-central1.run.app
DATABASE_URL=[Get from Supabase Dashboard]
```

### Step 3: Select Environments
For each variable, check:
- ‚úÖ Production
- ‚úÖ Preview  
- ‚úÖ Development

### Step 4: Save
Click "Save" for each one

## üö® Why This Keeps Happening:
1. **Vercel doesn't sync with local env files** (by design)
2. **Each deployment environment is isolated** (security)
3. **Environment variables must be set per platform**

## üìç Where to Check:
- **Local**: `.env.local` file
- **Production**: Vercel Dashboard
- **What's actually set**: https://always-bent.vercel.app/check

## üõ†Ô∏è One-Time Fix:
Once you set them in Vercel, they stay there forever unless you delete them.
