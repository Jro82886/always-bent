# ABFI Privacy & Purpose Statement

## 🎣 **What ABFI Tracking IS:**

**A PAID MEMBERS-ONLY COLLABORATIVE NETWORK**

ABFI is a **trusted community** of paying members who voluntarily share location data to:
- **Find fish together** - See where the fleet is having success
- **Save fuel** - Don't waste time searching blind
- **Validate conditions** - Confirm SST edges and chlorophyll blooms with real activity
- **Build collective knowledge** - Every trip makes everyone smarter
- **Support each other** - "There's fish here, come join me"

## ❌ **What ABFI Tracking IS NOT:**

**THIS IS NOT SURVEILLANCE**

- **NOT monitoring** - This is voluntary sharing, not watching
- **NOT tracking individuals** - It's about patterns, not people
- **NOT selling data** - Your data stays in the ABFI community
- **NOT required** - Turn it on when you want to share, off when you don't
- **NOT identifying** - Boat names visible only to community members
- **NOT permanent** - Delete your history anytime

## 🤝 **The ABFI Agreement:**

**EVERYONE IS EQUAL - NO EXCEPTIONS**

- All members pay the same
- All members follow the same rules
- Share to see, don't share and you don't see
- No special access, no backdoors, no exceptions

When you enable tracking, you're saying:
> "I want to help my fellow captains find fish, and I want their help finding fish too."

It's that simple. **We share to succeed together.**

## 🔒 **Your Control:**

1. **START/STOP anytime** - One button control
2. **Ghost mode** - Track without broadcasting (coming soon)
3. **Inlet-based** - Only share with your local fleet
4. **Delete history** - Remove your tracks anytime
5. **Anonymous in analysis** - SnipTool shows boat counts, never names

## 📊 **How Your Data Helps:**

When you track, you contribute to:
- **Heat maps** showing where fish are being caught
- **Pattern recognition** identifying productive conditions
- **Validation** of SST edges and chlorophyll blooms
- **Community intelligence** that helps everyone catch more

## 🚫 **We Will NEVER:**

- Sell your location data
- Share data with enforcement agencies
- Use data for compliance monitoring
- Share individual vessel tracks publicly
- Require tracking for app access
- Judge your fishing spots or methods

## ✅ **We ALWAYS:**

- Keep data within ABFI community
- Aggregate data for privacy (minimum 3 boats)
- Let you control your visibility
- Delete data upon request
- Encrypt position data
- Respect the fishing community

---

## **The Bottom Line:**

**ABFI is a PAID COMMUNITY where EVERYONE IS EQUAL.**

- **Same rules for everyone** - No special treatment
- **Vulnerable by design** - We trust our paying members
- **Extremely permissive** - Stop sharing anytime you want
- **Fair exchange** - Share to see, or don't share and don't see

We're not watching you - we're watching out for each other. Every captain who shares their position makes the entire fleet more successful. It's collective intelligence, not surveillance.

**"Never fish blind again" means fishing WITH each other, not watching OVER each other.**

*This is a paid members-only tool BY fishermen, FOR fishermen. We trust and protect our own.*
