# ABFI Report Schema & Data Flow

## Overview
ABFI has multiple types of reports that flow through the system. This document defines the schemas and explains exactly how data flows from user action to storage to display.

## Report Types

### 1. **Bite Reports** (Quick ABFI Button)
When a user presses the ABFI bite button on the map.

#### Schema: `bite_reports` table
```sql
bite_reports {
  id: UUID
  bite_id: TEXT (client-generated UUIDv7)
  user_id: UUID
  user_name: TEXT
  created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
  
  -- Location
  location: GEOGRAPHY(POINT)
  lat: DECIMAL(10,8)
  lon: DECIMAL(11,8)
  accuracy_m: DECIMAL
  inlet_id: TEXT
  
  -- Context (snapshot at bite time)
  context: JSONB {
    weather?: {  // From Stormglass API
      sstC: number
      windKt: number
      windDir: string
      swellFt: number
      swellPeriodS: number
      pressureHpa: number
    }
    moon?: { phase: string, illumPct: number }
    tides?: { next: { type: string, time: string, height: number } }
    sun?: { sunriseIso: string, sunsetIso: string }
  }
  
  -- User Input
  notes: TEXT
  fish_on: BOOLEAN
  species: TEXT
  
  -- Analysis
  status: 'pending_analysis' | 'analyzed' | 'analysis_failed'
  analysis: JSONB
  confidence_score: INTEGER
}
```

#### Flow:
1. User presses ABFI button
2. Client captures location, fetches `/api/stormio?lat={lat}&lng={lng}`
3. Saves to `bite_reports` with weather snapshot
4. Shows in Community feed as "âš¡ BITE" report

---

### 2. **Catch Reports** (Community Reports)
Full fishing reports with species, conditions, etc.

#### Schema: `catch_reports` table
```sql
catch_reports {
  id: UUID
  user_id: UUID
  captain_name: TEXT
  boat_name: TEXT
  
  -- Catch Details
  species: TEXT
  lat: FLOAT
  lng: FLOAT
  selected_inlet: TEXT
  
  -- Conditions (if from Snip Tool)
  sst_temp: FLOAT
  chl_level: FLOAT
  conditions: JSONB {
    weather?: { /* Stormglass snapshot */ }
    analysis?: { /* From Snip Tool */ }
  }
  
  notes: TEXT
  is_abfi_bite: BOOLEAN  // True if from ABFI button
  created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
}
```

#### Flow:
1. User submits via:
   - Community "Share Your Catch" modal
   - Snip Tool "Save as Report" 
   - ABFI Bite button (is_abfi_bite = true)
2. If from Snip Tool, includes full analysis + weather snapshot
3. Displays in Community feed with inlet chip

---

### 3. **Analysis Reports** (Snip Tool Results)
Temporary analysis results from the Snip Tool.

#### TypeScript Schema:
```typescript
type AnalysisResult = {
  // Area analyzed
  polygon: GeoJSON.Feature<GeoJSON.Polygon>
  bbox: [number, number, number, number]
  inletName: string
  
  // Analysis results
  summary: string
  recommendations: string[]
  
  // Ocean data
  oceanConditions?: {
    sst?: number
    sstGradient?: number
    chl?: number
    currentSpeed?: number
    distanceToEdge?: number
  }
  
  // Vessel activity
  vesselActivity?: {
    nearbyCount: number
    activityLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
    tracks?: Array<{
      type: 'gfw' | 'recreational'
      vesselName: string
      points: [number, number][]
    }>
  }
  
  // Hotspot detection
  hotspot?: {
    location: [number, number]
    confidence: number
  }
  
  // Environmental snapshot (from Stormglass)
  conditions?: {
    weather: { /* Stormglass data */ }
    moon: { phase: string, illumPct: number }
    tides: { events: Array<...> }
    lastIso: string
  }
}
```

#### Flow:
1. User draws polygon with Snip Tool
2. System analyzes:
   - SST/CHL from map tiles
   - Vessel tracks (GFW + user data)
   - Weather from `/api/stormio`
3. Shows modal with analysis
4. User can "Save as Report" â†’ creates `catch_report` with full snapshot

---

## Data Flow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Presses ABFI Button
```
1. Client: Capture GPS location
2. Client: POST /api/bite-reports with location
3. Server: Fetch Stormglass data for location
4. Server: Save to bite_reports with weather snapshot
5. Server: Return success
6. Client: Show confirmation
7. Community: Display as "âš¡ BITE" in feed
```

### Scenario 2: User Completes Snip Analysis
```
1. Client: Draw polygon on map
2. Client: Extract SST/CHL from visible tiles
3. Client: Fetch vessel tracks in area
4. Client: GET /api/stormio for weather
5. Client: Run analysis algorithm
6. Client: Show modal with results
7. User: Clicks "Save as Report"
8. Client: POST /api/reports with full analysis + conditions
9. Server: Save to catch_reports
10. Community: Display with analysis badge
```

### Scenario 3: Manual Community Report
```
1. User: Opens "Share Your Catch" modal
2. User: Fills species, notes, location
3. Client: POST /api/reports
4. Server: Optionally fetch current Stormglass (display only)
5. Server: Save to catch_reports
6. Community: Display in feed
```

## Important Rules

### Weather Data (Stormglass)
1. **ALWAYS** use `/api/stormio` endpoint
2. **NEVER** call Stormglass directly from client
3. **ALWAYS** save weather snapshot with reports
4. Saved snapshots are immutable (ground truth)

### Report Display
1. If report has saved conditions â†’ show saved data
2. If no conditions â†’ optionally fetch current (display only)
3. Bite reports show "âš¡ BITE" badge
4. Analysis reports show "ðŸ”¬ Analysis" badge

### Privacy
1. Location fuzzing applied server-side
2. Exact coordinates only visible to report owner
3. Public sees inlet-level location

### Retention
1. Bite reports: Auto-delete after 7 days
2. Catch reports: Permanent
3. Analysis results: Not saved unless user chooses

---

## API Endpoints

### `/api/bite-reports`
- POST: Create new bite report
- GET: Fetch recent bites (last 3 days)

### `/api/reports` 
- POST: Create catch report
- GET: Fetch community reports

### `/api/stormio`
- GET: Fetch weather/ocean conditions
- Params: `lat`, `lng`
- Returns: Normalized Stormglass data

### `/api/analyze`
- POST: Run ocean analysis
- Body: `{ bbox, layers, inletId }`
- Returns: Analysis results

---

## Database Queries

### Recent Community Activity
```sql
-- Get all reports for inlet in last 24h
SELECT * FROM catch_reports 
WHERE selected_inlet = $1 
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Get analyzed bites with good conditions
SELECT * FROM bite_reports
WHERE status = 'analyzed'
  AND confidence_score > 70
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days'
ORDER BY confidence_score DESC;
```

### User's Reports
```sql
-- All user's reports
SELECT * FROM catch_reports 
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- User's bites
SELECT * FROM bite_reports
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Frontend State Management

### Local Storage
- `abfi_community_reports`: Cached community feed
- `abfi_bite_logs`: Offline bite queue
- `abfi_analysis_history`: Recent analyses

### React State
- `useStore`: Current inlet, layers
- `AnalysisContext`: Active analysis
- `CommunityContext`: Feed + filters

This is the complete data flow. When live user data comes in, it follows these exact patterns.
