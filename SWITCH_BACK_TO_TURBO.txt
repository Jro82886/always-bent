# Switch CHL Back to Turbo (Blue-Green-Yellow)

## Current Issue:
- You have viridis (purple-green-yellow) but want turbo (blue-green-yellow)
- Turbo was working before and shows chlorophyll better!

## Quick Fix in Vercel:

**Find:** `CMEMS_CHL_WMTS_TEMPLATE`

**Change:** Look for `cmap:viridis` in the URL

**Replace with:** `cmap:turbo`

## The corrected URL should have:
```
STYLE=cmap:turbo
```

## Color Comparison:
- **Viridis**: Purple â†’ Green â†’ Yellow (less ocean-like)
- **Turbo**: Blue â†’ Cyan â†’ Green â†’ Yellow (perfect for ocean!)

## Why Turbo is Better for Chlorophyll:
- Blue = Clear ocean water (low chlorophyll)
- Cyan/Light Green = Transitional waters
- Green = Productive waters (medium chlorophyll)
- Yellow = Plankton blooms (high chlorophyll)

This matches what fishermen see - "green water" means bait!

## After changing to turbo:
1. Save in Vercel
2. Redeploy
3. The CHL button should show proper ocean colors again!

You were right to want more green - turbo gives you that natural blue-to-green-to-yellow progression that makes sense for ocean data! ðŸŒŠ
