## 💡 Mobile-First Features

### 1. **Haptic Feedback**
- Vibrate on proximity alerts
- Pulse on fish activity
- Confirm actions with haptics

### 2. **Voice Commands**
```javascript
"Hey ABFI, what's the SST at the canyon?"
"Log catch: 30 pound yellowfin"
"Where's the closest boat?"
"Navigate to yesterday's hotspot"
```

### 3. **Offline Mode**
- Save analyses for offshore
- Cache inlet data
- Queue logs for sync

### 4. **Smart Notifications**
```javascript
// Context-aware alerts
"SST break forming 5nm from your last spot"
"CaptainMike caught 3 YFT where you were yesterday"
"Perfect conditions match from Oct 15 trip"
```

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### 1. **Replace Map with Lists**
```tsx
// Instead of map markers
<ProximityList>
  {boats.sortBy(distance).map(boat => (
    <BoatCard key={boat.id}>
      <Distance>{boat.distance}nm</Distance>
      <Direction>{boat.bearing}°</Direction>
      <Activity>{boat.status}</Activity>
    </BoatCard>
  ))}
</ProximityList>
```

### 2. **Location Without Maps**
```tsx
// Use device sensors
const tracking = {
  position: GPS.getCurrentPosition(),
  heading: Compass.getHeading(),
  speed: GPS.getSpeed(),
  nearbyBoats: calculateProximity(boats, position)
};
```

### 3. **Swipe Navigation**
```tsx
<SwipeableViews>
  <IntelFeed />      // Swipe right
  <SavedAnalysis />  // Center
  <Trends />         // Swipe left
</SwipeableViews>
```

## 🎯 Bottom Navigation

```tsx
<MobileNav>
  <Tab icon="📡" label="Intel" />
  <Tab icon="💾" label="Saved" />
  <Tab icon="📊" label="Trends" />
  <Tab icon="🎤" label="Log" badge="●" />
  <Tab icon="👥" label="Fleet" />
</MobileNav>
```

## 🚀 Why This Works

1. **No Map Dependency** - Everything works through lists and cards
2. **Shareable Content** - Every analysis, trend, and report can be shared
3. **Social Proof** - Show friends your catches, patterns, achievements
4. **Quick Actions** - One-tap logging, voice commands
5. **Offline Capable** - Save everything for offshore use

## 📱 Progressive Disclosure

Start simple, reveal complexity:
1. **Basic**: Just show intel feed
2. **Engaged**: Unlock trends after 5 logs
3. **Power User**: Advanced patterns, historical analysis
4. **Fleet Leader**: Share reports, lead groups

This transforms ABFI from a "you need to be at your computer looking at maps" tool to a "pull out your phone and show your buddy" experience!
