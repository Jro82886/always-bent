# üîí Safe Sharing Guide for Fiverr Contractor

## ‚úÖ **SAFE TO SHARE:**

### 1. **Generic App Description**
"A SaaS platform for the fishing/marine industry with real-time data analysis and community features"

### 2. **Design Requirements**
- All the colors, fonts, and styling guides
- The logo files (they're just branding)
- General copy and messaging

### 3. **Technical Specs**
- "Redirect to our app after signup"
- "Pass member email via localStorage"
- "Use Memberstack for auth"

### 4. **Dummy URLs Initially**
Instead of your real app URL, tell them:
- "Redirect to: `https://app.example.com` (I'll provide real URL when we're ready to test)"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **SHARE CAREFULLY:**

### 1. **Your Vercel App URL**
- **Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM
- **Why:** It's already public, but no need to share until final testing
- **When to share:** After they've built the landing page, for final integration only
- **How to share:** "For testing, redirect to: https://always-bent.vercel.app/legendary"

### 2. **Domain Name**
- **Risk Level:** LOW
- **Can share:** "alwaysbentfishingintelligence.com"
- **Don't share:** GoDaddy login credentials (you'll connect it yourself)

---

## üö´ **NEVER SHARE:**

1. **GitHub Repository** - Your code is private
2. **Vercel Account Access** - They don't need it
3. **Database Credentials** - Not relevant for their work
4. **API Keys** - Keep all of these private
5. **User Data** - If you have any beta user info
6. **Revenue/Business Numbers** - Just say "SaaS platform"

---

## üí° **SMART APPROACH:**

### Phase 1: Initial Build (Share Minimal)
Tell contractor:
- "Build landing page with Memberstack"
- "Use placeholder URL for app redirect"
- "I'll provide final URL for testing"

### Phase 2: Testing (Share App URL)
Once they've built everything:
- Share: "https://always-bent.vercel.app/legendary"
- Test the flow together
- Confirm it works

### Phase 3: Handoff (Take Control)
- Get Webflow project transferred to you
- Get Memberstack project transferred to you
- Change all passwords immediately
- Connect your domain yourself

## üìù **SAMPLE FIVERR MESSAGE:**

```
Hi! I need a simple landing page built in Webflow with Memberstack authentication.

Project: SaaS platform for marine industry
Design: Dark theme (I'll provide colors/branding)
Functionality: Landing page + signup/login via Memberstack
Redirect: To our app (URL provided during testing)

I'll give you:
- Brand colors and copy
- Webflow account access
- Memberstack account access

You deliver:
- Working landing page
- Configured authentication
- Documentation

Timeline: 3-5 days
Budget: [Your budget]

Can you do this?
```

## üéØ **BOTTOM LINE:**

Your Vercel app URL (always-bent.vercel.app) is:
- **Not sensitive** - It's meant to be public eventually
- **Already protected** - Auth is bypassed for beta
- **Safe to share** - But only when needed for testing

The contractor only needs it to test that redirects work. Share it at the END, not the beginning.

**Your code, database, and API keys** - THOSE are sensitive. Never share those.
