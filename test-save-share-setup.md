# Save/Share Pills Test Setup

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Save/Share pills have been fully implemented in the SnipTool analysis modal.

### To Test:

1. **Enable the feature flag in .env.local:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_REPORTS_CONTRACT=true
   ```

2. **Run the app locally:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the flow:**
   - Go to Analysis page (/legendary/analysis)
   - Click "Select Area to Analyze" 
   - Draw a rectangle on the map
   - Wait for analysis to complete
   - In the modal footer, you'll see:
     - **Save** button (green gradient)
     - **Share** button (purple gradient)

4. **Expected behavior:**
   - **Save**: Creates report in database, shows "Saved" state
   - **Share**: Copies link like `/legendary/community/reports?reportId=xxx`
   - Toast notifications appear for success/errors

### Next Steps (Not Implemented Yet):
